## 🔧 **Critical Next Steps**

### **1. Email Automation Setup**

**Connect to Email Service:**
```bash
npm install @sendgrid/mail
# or
npm install resend
```

**Update API endpoints:**
- `/api/generate-report` - Generate PDF and send via email
- `/api/save-script` - Send script library via email

**Example with SendGrid:**
```javascript
import sgMail from '@sendgrid/mail';

sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY);

const msg = {
  to: email,
  from: 'reports@callwaitingai.dev',
  subject: 'Your Missed Call ROI Report',
  html: generatePDFReport(data),
  attachments: [{
    content: pdfBuffer,
    filename: 'missed-call-report.pdf',
    type: 'application/pdf'
  }]
};

await sgMail.send(msg);
```

### **2. Analytics Setup**

**Google Analytics 4:**
```javascript
// Add to layout.tsx
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=GA_MEASUREMENT_ID"></script>
<script
  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
    __html: `
      window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
      function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
      gtag('js', new Date());
      gtag('config', 'GA_MEASUREMENT_ID');
    `,
  }}
/>
```

**Track these events:**
- `tool_start` - When user opens calculator
- `tool_complete` - When user gets results
- `email_captured` - When user submits email
- `high_value_lead` - When lost revenue > £100k

### **3. Database Setup**

**Store leads and analytics:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE leads (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  industry VARCHAR(100),
  lost_revenue INTEGER,
  consent_given BOOLEAN,
  consent_timestamp TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE tool_usage (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  tool_name VARCHAR(100),
  user_ip VARCHAR(45),
  lost_revenue INTEGER,
  industry VARCHAR(100),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### **4. Email Sequences**

**Set up N8N or similar automation:**

**Email 1 (Immediate):**
- Subject: "Your Missed Call Report is Ready 📊"
- Content: PDF report + personalized insights
- CTA: "Book a 15-minute demo"

**Email 2 (Day 3):**
- Subject: "How [Similar Business] captured £148k in lost calls"
- Content: Case study with similar industry/results
- CTA: "Start free trial"

**Email 3 (Day 7):**
- Subject: "Still losing £12,000/month? 😬"
- Content: Urgency + social proof
- CTA: "Fix it today - Start Free Trial"
